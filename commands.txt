npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./assets/css/styles.css --watch

What This Command Does

-i ./src/input.css: This tells Tailwind that your input file (the one you edit) is located at src/input.css.

-o ./assets/css/styles.css: This tells Tailwind where to create the final output file. This is the file you link to in your HTML.

--watch: This is the most important part. It tells Tailwind to keep running in the background and automatically rebuild your output.css file every time you save a change in your HTML or input.css files.
